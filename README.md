## Lessons Learned


I built this as I was beginning to dig more into the intricacies of CSS so while I made sure to make use of React features to make the website, namely to make the countdown clock, this site could have been more easily built as a static html site with a comprehensive CSS file.

This did force me to get tricky with the CSS, especially as I made choices later in the build, such as adding a parralax scrolling effect. Namely I had to make sure to contend with the fact that the background image used in the header is actually an img tag with a position of absolute. This means as I was using background images and articles later in the build to delineate information cards I had to be sure their backgrounds covered the img tag completely.
## Roadmap

- Add more features
    - Add RSVP signup page
    - Add RSVP database (incl. plus one and meal selection)
